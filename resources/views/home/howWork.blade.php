									<p>You can refer friends in two ways either by word of mouth or through the various social media platform using your referral link which can be found on your dashboard.</p>
									<h6>Word of mouth</h6>
									<p>You can simply tell your friends  about the site. When they want to sign up; in the field called "referral email", they would input the email address you used in registering on the site. Immediately, he/she would be automatically tagged to you as his referral.</p>
									<h6>Using Referral link</h6>
									<p>This is the easiest and fastest way to refer. You can just click on "my referral link" on your dashboard and share each link with the social media buttons.</p>
									<h6>Commissions for referral</h6>
									<p>You are entitled to 1% commission of every drug prescription and 1% of every lab test the referred client pays for on the system for as long as 5years.</p> <p>Meaning for every consultation the client makes on the system that led to drug purchase or lab test request, you would get 1% of the transaction.</p>
									<div class="form-group"><a href="register">
									<input class="btn_1" name="submit" type="submit" value="Get Started!"></a><br><br>
									
									<h6>For Instance</h6>
									<p>If your referred client buys drug on the system that cost N5000 you will be entitled to: N50</p>
									<p>The more clients you refer, the more your commissions</p>
